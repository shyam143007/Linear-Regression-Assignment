## Conclusions
- year and atemp is positively correlated with the count of bikes rental per day.
- Light snow and Mist weather has negatively correlated with the count.
- July, November and December months are negatively correlated with the target variable count whereas March,September are positively correlated.
- Seasons like Spring is negatively correlated and Winter is positively correlated with the target variable count.
- holiday is negatively correlated with the target variable count.
- If there is high humidity there are less chances of renting a bike.
- People try to rent bikes if **windspeed is moderate or low**.
